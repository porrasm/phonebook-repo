Here are both the backend and the frontend. When you run 'npm start' going to localhost:3001 should give you the default view. 
Instead it gives an error 'Couldn't get /'

If you run this server and just the frontend, it will work so I'm pretty sure the problem isn't in the code, but in the configuration.

Initially this was a separate repo. .git was removed to avoid using submodules.
